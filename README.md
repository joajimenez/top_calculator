# TOP Calculator Project

This is a basic calculator web application that allows users to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. The user can also calculate the square root of a number and find a percentage of a number.

## Features

- Addition: Add two numbers together.
- Subtraction: Subtract one number from another.
- Multiplication: Multiply two numbers together.
- Division: Divide one number by another.
- Square Root: Calculate the square root of a number.
- Percentage: Find a percentage of a number.

## Getting Started

To use the calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The calculator interface will be displayed, and you can start entering numbers and selecting operations.

## How to Use

1. Enter Numbers: Click on the number buttons (0-9) to input the desired numbers. You can also use the decimal point (.) button to input decimal numbers.

2. Select Operation: Click on the operation buttons (+, -, *, /, √, %) to select the desired arithmetic operation.

3. Calculate Result: Once you have entered the first number, selected an operation, and entered the second number (if applicable), click the "=" button to calculate the result.

4. Clear: To start a new calculation, click on the "C" button to clear the current operation.

## UI Elements

- `num1-el`: The element that displays the first number entered by the user.
- `num2-el`: The element that displays the second number entered by the user.
- `operator-el`: The element that displays the selected operation.
- `results-el`: The element that displays the calculated result.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For creating the structure of the calculator interface.
- CSS: For styling the calculator layout and buttons.
- JavaScript: For handling user interactions and performing the arithmetic operations.
